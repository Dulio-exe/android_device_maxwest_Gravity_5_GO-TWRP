## Explanation for What this Repo is:

Dear who ever is reading this,

5 years ago (Its 2023 while im writing this), I found myself with the possension of a phone and while being curious with intricacies of technology once again. At young age of 12, armed with curiosity and a newfound budget phone, I embarked on the journey of creating a device tree. The motivation behind this endeavor stemmed from my desire to understand the inner workings of the phone, to unravel the mysteries that lay beneath its boxy exterior. As I delved into the world of device trees, I knew I was treading on unfamiliar ground. The excitement of exploration mingled with the awareness that mistakes were inevitable, given my limited experience. Yet, with each line of code, I was not merely shaping a device tree; I was sculpting my understanding of technology. Today's journal entry marks a chapter in my early foray into the world of coding, a humble testament to my youthful curiosity and the courage to embrace the learning curve. This project also took 6 months of research, and I sometimes think back to this project.

Yours in curiosity,
Shib
